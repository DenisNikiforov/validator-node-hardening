This repository provides a lightweight security hardening playbook for blockchain validator nodes, focusing on **firewall rules** and **SSH access controls** using Ansible.

## üîê Attack Mitigated

**Node Infrastructure Exposure** ‚Äî Nodes exposed to the internet with open ports and weak SSH configurations are vulnerable to:

- Brute-force attacks  
- Remote code execution  
- Unauthorized configuration changes  
- DoS via unfiltered public access

This mitigation helps prevent these risks by tightly controlling network access.

- Allows Ethereum P2P traffic on TCP port 30303  
- Allows SSH only from whitelisted IP addresses  
- Disables password-based SSH authentication
